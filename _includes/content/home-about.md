# About

I investigate issues relevant to political economy and political institutions, including the politicization of food safety problems, the legitimacy and efficiency of global governance institutions, the politics of innovation and drivers of foreign aid. Additionally, I explore issues related to authoritarian governance, particularly in China. Methodologically, I have developed a strong interest in missing data imputation, multilevel modeling and Bayesian statistics. 

Using a multi-method research strategy, which included the use of large-N analyses, machine-learning algorithims, and survey experiments, my work explores the politics of food safety through the lens of food crises in China. This work was informed by in-depth interviews I conducted during in China, sponsored in part by a Fulbright-Hayes Doctoral Dissertation Research Award.  

More recently, I have been leading a large scale international effort to systematically document government policies made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic with the CoronaNet Research Project. With colleagues here at the Hochshule f{\"u}r Politik and from NYU Abu Dhabi, Nazarbayev University, the University of Brasilia, the Hertie School of Governance, the University of Southern California and the Fors Mars Group, we have organized to date more than a thousand volunteer research assistants to collect data on government policies made at both the national and subnational levels in response to COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic.

I received a PhD in Political Science from Duke University in 2017. I also completed the coursework necessary to fulfill the requirements for a masters in statistics at Duke. I majored in Economics and Political Economy as an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley.
