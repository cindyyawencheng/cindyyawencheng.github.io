# About


Hello and welcome! My name is Cindy Cheng. I am a political scientist and data scientist.  As a political scientist, my work has primarily engaged in examining the politics of crisis, including how both governments and people react to crisis and uncertainty as well as how their actions can contribute to it. I have explored these topics across a wide variety of issue areas common to the field of international political economy, including the COVID-19 pandemic, food safety, foreign aid and trade.  As a data scientist, I have deep expertise in applying a wide variety of methodological approaches ( e.g. causal inference, predictive modeling) and tools (e.g. (non)linear modeling, machine learning, Bayesian statistics) to forward new insights and research. 

Since 2020, I have been leading a large scale international effort to systematically document government policies (e.g. lockdowns, travel bans) made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic with the CoronaNet Research Project. I took the lead in developing the methodology, data infrastructure and project infrastructure to standardize unstructured information on COVID-19 policies made all around in the world into. With more than 180,000 observations, it is the largest event-based dataset of its kind and a crucial resource for forwarding research on the COVID-19 pandemic. This work was only possible by fostering strong partnerships and collaborations across multiple research institutions (e.g. the Technical University of Munich, NYU Abu Dhabi, Nazarbayev University, University of Brasilia, University of Southern California,  University of Iceland) as well as the recruitment and training of a large community of 1700 volunteer and paid research assistants to collect the data.

I received a PhD in Political Science from Duke University in 2017. I also completed the coursework necessary to fulfill the requirements for a masters in statistics at Duke. I majored in Economics and Political Economy as an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley. I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Technical University of Munich from 2016 to 2023. My work and training has received funding support from the EU Horizon 2020 Program, Fulbright-Hayes Program, and the U.S. Department of Education.
