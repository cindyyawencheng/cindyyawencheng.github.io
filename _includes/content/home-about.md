# About

My research investigates issues relevant to political economy and political institutions, including the politicization of food safety problems, the legitimacy and efficiency of global governance institutions, the politics of innovation and drivers and outcomes of foreign aid. Additionally, I also explore issues related to authoritarian governance, particularly in China. Methodologically, I have also developed a strong interest in missing data imputation, multilevel modeling and Bayesian statistics.

I received a PhD in Political Science from Duke University in 2017. My dissertation explored the politics of food safety through the lens of food crises in China. I am currently working on turning my dissertation into a book project.
