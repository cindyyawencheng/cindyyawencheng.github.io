# About

I investigate issues relevant to political economy and political institutions, including the politicization of food safety problems, the legitimacy and efficiency of global governance institutions, the politics of innovation and drivers of foreign aid. Additionally, I explore issues related to authoritarian governance, particularly in China. Methodologically, I have developed a strong interest in missing data imputation, multilevel modeling and Bayesian statistics.

Using a multi-method research strategy, which included the use of large-N analyses, machine-learning algorithims, and survey experiments, my dissertation explored the politics of food safety through the lens of food crises in China. This work was informed by in-depth interviews I conducted during in China, sponsored in part by a Fulbright-Hayes Doctoral Dissertation Research Award. I am currently working on turning my dissertation into a book project.

I received a PhD in Political Science from Duke University in 2017. I also completed the coursework necessary to fulfill the requirements for a masters in statistics at Duke.
