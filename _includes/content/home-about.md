# About

One strand of my research explores a wide swath of international political economy issues, including competition policy, foreign aid, global governance while another strand focuses on authoritarian politics in China. I have also developed a strong interest in political methodology, including missing data imputation, multilevel modeling and Bayesian statistics.

I received a PhD in Political Science from Duke University in 2017. My dissertation explored the politics of food safety through the lens of food crises in China. I am currently working on turning my dissertation into a book project.
