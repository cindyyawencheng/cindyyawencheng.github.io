Hello! I am a political scientist and data scientist.  

As a political scientist, my work has primarily engaged in examining the politics of crisis, including how both governments and people react to crisis and uncertainty as well as how their actions can contribute to it. I have explored these topics across a wide variety of issue areas common to the field of international political economy, including the COVID-19 pandemic, food safety, foreign aid and trade.  

As a data scientist, I have deep expertise in applying a wide variety of methodological approaches ( e.g. causal inference, predictive modeling) and tools (e.g. (non)linear modeling, machine learning, Bayesian statistics) to forward new insights and research. 

 
I received a PhD in Political Science from Duke University in 2017. I also completed the coursework necessary to fulfill the requirements for a masters in statistics at Duke. I majored in Economics and Political Economy as an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley. I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Technical University of Munich from 2016 to 2023. My work has received funding support from the EU Horizon 2020 Program, Fulbright-Hayes Program, and the U.S. Department of Education.
