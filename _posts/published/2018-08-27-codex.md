<div class="message">
Since 1963, the Codex Alimentarius Commission, an inter-governmental organization jointly administered by the FAO and WHO, has developed standards, codes of practice, guidelines and recommendations relevant to the promotion and maintenance of food safety. Given that it not only has a mandate to protect consumer health and remove unnecessary barriers to trade but that its standards are explicitly used by the WTO to adjudicate between these two objectives, the Codex's effect on global food safety is significant. However, while its authority to play arbiter relies on its scientific legitimacy, it has not been entirely free of political and economic influence.
