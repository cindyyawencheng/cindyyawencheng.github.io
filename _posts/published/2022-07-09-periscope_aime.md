<div class="message">
The Data Atlas is the centerpiece of the PERISCOPE projectâ€™s data-driven research. The Atlas constitutes a centralized access point for the exploration, visualization and analysis of the original data produced by PERISCOPE partners, integrated with the most relevant information about the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on health, economics, policy-making, and society at large. The Atlas interfaces and tools make such data readily available to the research community, decision makers and the general public, providing the means to amplify its reach and impact. The present demo, showcases the features of v1.2 release of the Atlas, 18 months from the project kick-off, and some of the planned enhancements to be delivered until project month 24.
