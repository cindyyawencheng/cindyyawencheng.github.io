Although issue salience is high for both China and Vietnam across these international health organizations, China's engagement with these international organizations is generally more substantive than Vietnam's, partly because of China's greater economic and political resources. That being said, the nature of participant engagement is often heavily influenced by the nature of the international organization itself and does not always privilege the stakeholder with the greater resources. <!--The results from our analyses suggest that while the integration of previously marginalized actors into global governance issues tracks closely with changes in political and economic status,-->
