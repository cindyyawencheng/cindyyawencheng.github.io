<div class="message">
As food safety problems continue to proliferate world-wide, numerous studies have investigated consumer willingness to pay for food safety attributes. However, less work has explicitly explored whether the perceived credibility of regulatory bodies affects consumers' purchasing decisions. Indeed, it follows that if consumers do not widely possess the tools and knowledge necessary to evaluate their food safety levels autonomously, neither can they validate regulatory efforts that purport to do so on their behalf. Using original survey data from China, this article finds evidence to suggest that trust plays an important role both in explaining consumers' willingness to pay for certified pork (indeed more important than price) and in shaping consumer confidence in food safety levels more broadly. By employing both willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA) questions, this article further finds that the relationship between trust and regulatory buy-in is sensitive to framing conditions.
