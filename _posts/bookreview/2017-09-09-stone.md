<i> Excerpt: </i> "With this new book, Randall Stone offers a dynamic account of how inter-national organizations (IOs) really function. He makes his case in three parts:first by laying out his main argument and its formal model, second by applyingit to various case studies, and third by rigorously testing it with regard to theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF). In so doing, Stone builds on his previousresearch on the IMF and makes an important contribution to the understand-ing of international organizations in general.""
