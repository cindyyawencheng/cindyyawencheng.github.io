    description: Since 2020, I have been leading a large scale international effort to systematically document government policies (e.g. lockdowns, travel bans) made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic with the CoronaNet Research Project. I took the lead in developing the methodology, data infrastructure and project infrastructure to standardize unstructured information on COVID-19 policies made all around in the world into. With more than 180,000 observations, it is the largest event-based dataset of its kind and a crucial resource for forwarding research on the COVID-19 pandemic. This work was only possible by fostering strong partnerships and collaborations across multiple research institutions (e.g. the Technical University of Munich, NYU Abu Dhabi, Nazarbayev University, University of Brasilia, University of Southern California,  University of Iceland) as well as the recruitment and training of a large community of 1700 volunteer and paid research assistants to collect the data.

    description: Contaminated food sickens more than 600 million people a year, representing a serious and ubiquitous risk to human health. In work supported by a Fulbright-Hayes Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad Fellowship, I explain how concerns about economic growth and political accountability can both affect the likelihood of food safety crises and shape subsequent citizen and governmental responses to them, with a focus on China. See <a target="_blank" href="https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/39b4775c-17c4-4cd1-a26b-8cd9f4040649/content">here</a> for more information on my work.

    description: I explore how dyadic and network relationships among countries can shape how crises salient to the field of international political economy evolve. Questions that my co-authors and I research include the factors which drive foreign aid in the wake of natural disasters as well as the relationship between international trade and conflict.
